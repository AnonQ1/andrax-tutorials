# How to Hack Mobile Networks 3G/4G [ part 1 ]

> Mobile telecommunication networks are today one of the most important pillars of modern society

> Hacking these networks is more than an attack is proof that you are one of the best! In hacking or you are 1 or 0


## How mobile networks works?

Mobile telecommunications networks have very intricate infrastructures that require a lot of study time to understand.

But I will try to explain as much as possible in this article.

### Introduction

- 1st Generation Analog Systems
  - Analog Telecommunication
  - No data transmission, only voice transmission
  
- 2nd Generation Digital Systems
  - Purely digital technology
  - Circuit switching: dedicated point-to-point connections during calls
  - TDMA, GSM, CDMA
  - Circuit-switched data services (HSCSD)
  - Very slow data transmission  
  
- 2.5 â€“ 3rd Generation
  - Mix of circuit switching and packet-switching
  - Packet-switched data
  - Allows mobile networks to transmit IP packets to the Internet
  - GPRS, EDGE, CDMA2000
  
- 4th Generation
  - All IP-based secured packet switched network (IPv6 supported)
  - Voice also transmitted over IP
  - LTE, WiMAX
  
### Differences in structure, equipment and protocols  

2G | 3G | 4G/LTE
------------ | ------------- | -------------
BTS | NodeB	| eNodeB
BSC | merged into NodeB | merged into eNodeB
MSC/VLR | RNC | MME, MSC Proxy
HLR | HLR, IMS HSS, HE | LTE SAE HSS, SDR/SDM
STP | STP,SG | Legacy STP
GGSN | GGSN | PDN GW
SGSN | SGSN | MME/SGW
IN | IN/PCRF | PCRF
RAN Firewall | RAN Firewall | SeGW
